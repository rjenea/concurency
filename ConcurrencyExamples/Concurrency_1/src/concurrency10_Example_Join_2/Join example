Here in this very simple example, one thread performs addition, one thread performs multiplication, and the main thread performs the division based on the results of the
addition and multiply threads. 
Since there is no need to communicate data between threads, we only need to consider the order of thread execution.
In the ThreadRunner (ie main) thread, addition and multiplication join the main thread. 
The join() method is used when we want the parent thread to wait until the threads which call join() end. 
In this case, we want addition and multiplication to complete first and then do the division.
